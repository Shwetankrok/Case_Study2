<h2>Q: Revenue lost from Attrition</h2>
<h3><br>Here I was confused with 2 options as to what exactly is needed </br></h3>
<h2><br>Option 1:</br>
<br>Difference between Revenue for year i.e. Revenue 2016 - Revenue 2015 value will present in row with year 2016.</br>
<br>Similarly Revenue 2017 - Revenue 2016 value will be present in row with year 2017 </br>
</h2>
<img src="C:/Users/shwer/OneDrive/Desktop/New folder/q7.png">
<h2><br>Option 2:</br>
<br>Getting Customer which are present in 2015 but absent in 2016 and getting Total revenue for such Customers equals to Revenue lost. Similarly for For Customers with 2016 and 2017.</br>
</h2>

<h2>Finding Customers which are present in all 3 years and getting top 5 customers who contribute maximum to Net Revenue</h2>
<img src="C:/Users/shwer/OneDrive/Desktop/New folder/q9.png">
</h2>
<h2> <br>Few Additions I could have made but not did due to time issue are:</br>
<br> 1: I could have done Customer Segementation based on Customers who are present in all 3 years would have grouped them 1 cluster or would have given some discounts/offers to Customers who left after an year to help them to stay </br>
<br>2: Customer Segementation based on Customers grouped together based on their Contributions to Net revenue </br>
<br>3: Forecasted the chances of customer staying for next year and their contribution to Net revenue </br>
